## History
According to [Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Citadel),

> The Citadel is the headquarters of the Order of Maesters, scholars who advise the lords of the Seven Kingdoms on matters scientific, medical, and historical.

> The Citadel was founded many centuries ago to promote and increase learning and knowledge in Westeros. It is administered by the Conclave, the ruling council of archmaesters. The Citadel is also where young men from the entire continent are trained to become Maesters.

> In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Citadel is described as a university-like complex of buildings extending along both banks of the River Honeywine in Oldtown, linked by graceful bridges. The Isle of Ravens is the oldest part of the Citadel and the site of the ravenry, from where the maesters send messenger ravens out to all parts of the Seven Kingdoms. Other locations of note in the Citadel include the Seneschal's Court, Weeping Dock, and Scribe's Hearth.
