## History
According to [Game of Thrones Wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Citadel):

> The Citadel is the headquarters of the Order of Maesters, scholars who advise the lords of the Seven Kingdoms on matters scientific, medical, and historical.

The Citadel was founded many centuries ago to promote and increase learning and knowledge in Westeros. It is administered by the Conclave, the ruling council of archmaesters. The Citadel is also where young men from the entire continent are trained to become Maesters.
